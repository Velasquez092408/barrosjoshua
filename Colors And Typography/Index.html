        <p class="flow-text">Once upon a time, there was a rabbit. A rabbit walked into the park and got a rest. At the same time, the rabbit saw the turtle walked so slowly.Then, the rabbit went to the turtle to say hello to the turtle. “Hello, turtle, why you walked so slowly?”.The turtle answered, ” Hi rabbit, exactly I am not walking now, but I am running now”. “Hahahahahha” the rabbit laughed, “What did you say? running is like that? running is like this”.The rabbit ran so fast and make the turtle get shocked and get angry at the same time.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">After the rabbit ran so fast, the angry turtle challenged him “Hey rabbit, you are so arrogant, let’s race”.and then the rabbit laughed again “hahaha hahaha, take a race? with you? haha! you are a slow turtle”.but the turtle convinces himself “I can win!”. The rabbit said, “okay, okay let’s go, tomorrow we will meet here again to take a race”.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">The next day, they have already prepared to take a race. Mr. Frog also came as a referee. “One… two… three… go!” said the frog.The rabbit immediately ran so fast and left the turtle behind. “Catch me if you can!” shouted the rabbit. But, the turtle just smiled at him.</p>
